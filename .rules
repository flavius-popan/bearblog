You are working with files for a personal blog project with the following key details:

- Blog URL: https://flaviuspopan.com
- Platform: BearBlog (https://bearblog.dev)
- Access limitations: You cannot directly modify all page source files due to platform constraints
- Documentation reference: https://docs.bearblog.dev/

When making changes, consider the BearBlog platform's capabilities and limitations. Focus on modifications that work within the platform's framework.

Add comments sparingly and strategically:
- Focus on WHY, not WHAT
- Only for complex logic requiring clarification
- High-value explanations when necessary
- Do NOT edit unrelated comments
- NEVER use comments to communicate with users or describe changes
